   Total Percentage:  9/15 = 60% which is a D on this deliverable.

The only reason for the low earned value is that there were two sections you
didn't address.  More diagrams is always a good idea, for two reasons:
   1) it helps the person reading about the system to better understand
   2) it helps YOU as you are designing the system to think about the way it
      will work and what the parts are, as well as how they will interact to
      make the application work the way it should

Try not to assume that what you have in your head is actually what you will
be implementing!  That's the mistake I made in my industry jobs quite a few
times...
