Comments:
---------
Nice work!

On problem 4.2 the actual critical path is G, D, E, M, Q.  I think you didn't
   put the first letter in, assuming the critical path was the time moving
   from the start point onward; you got the duration right at 32 days.

On problem 4.4 I don't see a Gantt chart anywhere... ACK!

On problem 5.3, there are a couple of your answers which are inconsistent
   with the book's answers.  It should be:
      B, U&F, U&F, U&F, N, N, N, N, N, F, F, U&F, U&F, U&F, U&F, U&F
   pretty close, though...

On problem 5.9, nice job here!

Good effort overall, now keep it up, Khalid!
