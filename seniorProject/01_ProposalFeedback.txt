Project Proposal Feedback
Project: SOS
=========================
Proposal Document [2 points]:
   Excellent work on this document, Khalid!  You know how I feel about this
   project to begin with, but you have done a great job of capturing all of
   the details in this proposal.

Proposal Presentation [3 points]:
   Good work on the presentation, too.  I like the slide template, subdued
   colors are so easy on the eyes.  You have great diagrams to show what you
   intend, and you have obviously put thought into this.

Summary:
--------
Total:  5% out of 5% for this deliverable.

Nice job overall!  Great start to the semester.
