SDD: ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN SECTION:
   Major software components section
      Section not done.

   Major software interactions section
      OK, I see where this is.  It is pretty minimal, though.  You list six
      different parts in the introduction section, but only three of them
      are listed as interacting with each other.  Does this mean that the
      other three are 'standalone' parts?

   Architectural design diagrams section
      This is a good diagram for showing the system flow and some of the
      operations and interfaces.  It could use some explanatory text so the
      reader knows what they are looking at and can better understand how it
      shows the system.  This one diagram is helpful, but don't be afraid of
      doing more diagrams ~ a picture is worth a thousand words, right? :D
