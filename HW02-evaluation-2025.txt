Comments:
---------

problem 5-1, very complete analysis!  Nice work.

problem 5-2, since this is a very trivial application on a phone, monolithic
   architecture is actually preferable.  You make a good case for component-
   based, though...

problem 5-6, good thought on this one, too.  Because ClassyDraw is pretty
   basic, you can probably get away with just saving the files and using the
   file system utilities for the rest.

problem 5-8, the focus here was to make an actual diagram, not just say what
   should be ON the diagram.

problem 6-2, you have a new 'Properties' class which is a subclass of every
   other class.  This is actually a bit nonsensical.  What you should have
   is the 'Drawable' class at the top like you do, then have two subclasses
   from that, 'LineDrawable' and 'Text'.  Then from 'LineDrawable' you need
   two subclasses, 'Line' and 'Fillable', with the second one of those being
   the superclass for the three shape classes.

Excellent work ~ keep it up!
